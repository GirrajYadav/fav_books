<p>It is the holy ancient <em>'Granth'</em> or a religious book contains hymns,sanskrit shlokas with their hindi meaning.It contains so valuable lessons of life that we all should opt
 as because the holy Lord Krishna(an incarnation of Vishnu) preaching Arujna itself.Lord krishna was Arjuna friend as well as his charioteer and Arjuna called them by saying <em>Madhav or keshav</em>.when Arjuna had to
 crusade against his own relatives their own grandfather and teachers the Lord Krishna sermonize Arjuna by saying :</p>
 <p><strong>हतो वा प्राप्यसि स्वर्गम्, जित्वा वा भोक्ष्यसे महिम्।
   तस्मात् उत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चय:॥</strong>
 </p>
 <p> 
 The meaning of this shloka is: If you (Arjuna) attain Viragati in battle, then you will get heaven and if you are victorious you will enjoy the happiness of the earth… So get up,
 O Kaunteya (Arjuna), and make war with determination.(Here Lord Krishna has discussed the result of present karma, which means that there is nothing better than present karma. </p>
 <p>Accordingly, the title has been interpreted as "the Song of God" by the theistic schools,"the Song of the Lord","the Divine Song" by others.In India, its Sanskrit name is often
 written as Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, श्रीमद् भगवद् गीता (the latter two words often contracted with a compound alphabet as भगवद्गीता), where the Shrimad prefix is used to denote a high degree of respect.
 In the Indian tradition, the Bhagavad Gita, as well as the epic Mahabharata of which it is a part, is attributed to sage Vyasa,whose full name was Krishna Dvaipayana, also
 called Veda-Vyasa.According to the Indologist Arvind Sharma, the Gita is generally accepted to be a 2nd-century BCE text. </p>

to give practical education in every aspect of life to human beings.It mainly presents the potrayl for the progress of religion, culture, justice, peace, education and 
all-oriented human life.</p>
<p>Acharya Chanakya is a great pride to India.He is self respecting ,virtuous and sober by nature;Sharp with intelligence; Firm of intent.The former is believed that Chanakya time
to be 326 years old.He gained education from takshila by departing from his residence pataliputra.He became a professor of politics by pleasing scholars from his maturity.
But his life was always engrossed in introspection. His heart would become unwell after seeing the country's misdeeds.They could not bear the downfall of India through blunt 
politics and communal attitude.Therefore, by his far-sighted thinking, he made an unusual attempt to tie the country together by making a detailed plan. </p>
